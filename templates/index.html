        <h2>Cardiotocograms and Their Role in Reducing Child & Maternal Mortality</h2>
        <p>
            Reducing child mortality remains a key objective in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, 
            representing major progress in global human development. By 2030, the UN envisions that all nations 
            will end preventable deaths among newborns and children under the age of five, with a goal of 
            <strong>no more than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Closely tied to this concern is the issue of maternal mortality, which accounted for approximately 
            <strong>295,000 deaths globally in 2017</strong>. A staggering 94% of these occurred in low-resource settings, 
            and the vast majority were preventable with access to better healthcare and timely intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
            One promising and cost-effective method to help address both child and maternal mortality is the use of 
            <strong>Cardiotocograms (CTGs)</strong>. These devices monitor fetal well-being by sending ultrasound pulses 
            and interpreting the feedback, providing insight into vital indicators such as fetal heart rate, 
            fetal movements, and uterine contractions. Their affordability and simplicity make CTGs a valuable tool 
            in both advanced and resource-limited clinical environments.
        </p>
        <p> 
            These records were reviewed and classified by three experienced obstetricians into three categories: 
            <strong>Normal</strong>, <strong>Suspect</strong>, and <strong>Pathological</strong>, allowing for further 
            analysis and potential automation of fetal health assessment.
